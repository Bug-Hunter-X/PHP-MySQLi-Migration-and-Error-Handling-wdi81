This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions and the absence of error handling. The `bug.php` file shows the flawed code.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version using the `mysqli_*` functions and including thorough error handling.  This example highlights the importance of using modern, secure, and well-handled database interactions in PHP.
